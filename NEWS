GVPE NEWS

2.25 Sat Jul 13 06:42:33 CEST 2013
    - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: no longer enable udp protocol if no other
      protocols are enabled - this is necessary when you have nodes with
      completely unknown protocols, to force mediated connection requests.
    - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: dns transport protocol bumped to version 2.
    - core protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - switch to using RSA_generate_key_ex, which is the badly documented
      and needlessly more complicated replacement for the RSA_generate_key
      function which is now deprecated.
    - support additional hmac hashes: sha256 and sha512, usually truncated.
    - change public exponent for rsa keys from 65535 to 65537, for
      efficiency reasons - only affects new keys.
    - nodes would sometimes declare transport endpoints valid despite
      the protocol not being configured locally.
    - new global configuration options: chroot, chuser, chuid, chgid,
      to chroot to a specified or anonymous new root, and change user id.
    - new global configuration options seed_device and seed_interval,
      to configure another device than /dev/urandom for random seeds,
      and to configure a regular imterval to reseed the rng.
    - prefer inet_aton over gethostbyname, as the latter is not guaranteed
      to "resolve" literal ip addresses.
    - configure did NOT detect openssl 1.0 because SHA1_version became
      private (patch by TANIGUCHI Takaki).
    - fix a bug where nodes would tell the other side that it supports
      the same protocols as that other side, instead of its own.
    - add zlib when found, as openssl depends on it in newer versions.
    - work around append-bugs in uclibc by using an extra seek.
    - new "include" directive for the config file.
    - gvpectrl no longer evaluates any "on" directives.
    - icmp and rawip protocols were NOT upgradable to each other.
    - major, but incremental, dns transport improvements:
       - do not simply abort in some error cases in the dns transport,
         but try to recover.
       - allow lowercase/uppercase alises for base-n encodings that do
         not rely on case.
       - use base26 instead of base22 encoding for dns syn's, and
         base36 instead of base22 for headers (saves one byte/packet).
       - back off far quicker in dns tunnel when idling - increases
         latency on an idle link somewhat, but avoids hundreds of
         needless packets.
       - poll more aggressively when idling in dns (poll once per
         second as opposed to once per 5 seconds).
       - reduce dns send payload size to allow greater rate of ack
         messages (should help sack and ipv6).
    - allow for ip options in rawip/icmp transports, even though gvpe
      does NOT generate them.
    - upgrade to autoconf 2.69, automake 1.11.
    - upgrade to libev 4 API.
    - replace COPYING file by actual GPLv3 - files were relicensed to GPLv3
      earlier but COPYING was forgotten.

2.24 Sat Feb 12 05:15:48 CET 2011
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - due to a bug, when packets were lost, a connection could go into a
      state where a ping/connection request from another node would be
      ignored, leading to connections not being re-established.
    - due to a bug, compression was almost always enabled.
    - enable-max-mtu was actually enable-mtu, contrary to documentation.
    - add nfmark support.
    - add node-change script support.
    - new DESTSI variable for node-xxx scripts.
    - updated codingstyle a bit, declared truly static stuff as static.
    - clarify compression docs.

2.22 Sun Feb  1 17:25:28 CET 2009
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - enabled icmp/tcp/http-proxy protocols by default.
    - updated copyright in program greetings.
    - fix some configure messages.
    - updated to libev 3.52.

2.21 Wed Sep  3 06:56:27 CEST 2008
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - add missing ev++.h include header to tarball, which everybody
      who tested it apparently had in their include path :-(. Caught
      by Karl Kleinpaste and Marcus Kong.

2.2  Mon Sep  1 06:28:09 CEST 2008
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
      but upgrade is recommended to due changed ondemand behaviour.
    - new per-node options max-ttl and max-queue.
    - convert from iom.C to libev, a high-performance event loop
      (http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev).
    - tcp connections were leaking in some cases.
    - retry more aggressively (once/s) to establish a connection if
      new packets arrive for it.
    - save a lot of setsockopt calls when the tos does NOT change.
    - honor disabled even on initial connect attempt.
    - changed callback mechanism to be slightly less portable
      but more efficient mechanism (standards-compliant c++ compilers
      should work).
    - increased receive window positive size, to allow for massive
      packet loss due to occasional longer drop-outs.
    - send RST when a positive window size violation is detected, but
      not in other cases, to reconnect more quickly.
    - upgraded liblzf to version 3.4.
    - dropped -fno-exceptions due to ev++.h using it.
    - node-up/down scripts are now run in sequence.
    - new -q switch for gvpectrl, for when you run it often.
    - work around the horribly inconsistent, ad-hoc, ever-changing
      and broken texinfo syntax. YMMV. avoid texinfo.
    - keepalive is more aggressive now, sensding ping's every 3 seconds
      and killing the conenction after 15 seconds.
    - bugfixes.

2.01 Thu Mar 29 19:26:04 CEST 2007
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - bugfix of callback.h, might have cause callback return values to
      be corrupted on architectures like sparc before.
    - dns transport retries more aggressively.
    - updated documentation, improved dns transport reliability
      and throughput.
    - added experimental support for sha256 and sha512 digests.

2.0 Mon Dec  5 13:59:26 CET 2005
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - implement allow-direct, deny-direct node config statements.
    - implemented != for sockinfo. This fixes a bug where
      gvpe sent packets to the old ip address of another host
      even though it had received packets from its new address.
      This only causes problems if you forget to -HUP your gvpe after
      your ip address changed, which is *required*.
    - sets close-on-exec flag on tcp connections. This fixes a bug
      where child processes kept tcp connections open and caused
      connections to fail when only one side can connect.
    - fixed a bug in receive sequence checking that made gvpe
      accept out-of-window packets in most cases.
    - tighter limit for the maximum sequence # to avoid overflow
      conditions + allow more headroom for packet reordering.
    - replace some asserts that trapped config mismatches by
      more useful log messages.
    - fix spurious extra newline in some log messages.

1.9 Tue Apr 19 06:21:50 CEST 2005
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - WARNING: this version checks the return value of if-up etc.
      scripts and exits on failure.
    - IMPORTANT: run if-up/node-up etc. scripts via /bin/sh.
    - IMPORTANT: interface initialization (MAC, MTU) is now done
      automatically in most configurations.
    - options can now be specified on the gvpe command line, too.
    - make some DNS transport values configurable and document them.
    - improved OS specific information in gvpe.osdep(5).
    - new tap device type "native/darwin", that supports the tap
      driver available for darwin (thanks to matthew mead who tested
      it out with me in a long session). tincd/darwin is still available.
    - new device type "tincd/bsd", which is a newer version of the
      *bsd-drivers taken from tinc.
    - fixed a bug in relying on the order of global construction
      when tcp transport was enabled. The fix makes it use no
      cpu time unless it is in use, too.
    - information about other nodes is now available to if-up etc. scripts.
    - the value of the config variable if-up-data is passed to the if-up
      etc. scripts.
    - skip unparsable config lines with a warning instead of stopping
      parsing and continuing with a certainly unusable config.

1.8 Fri Mar 18 00:58:55 CET 2005
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - enable-udp = yes is now default only when no other protocols
      are enabled. otherwise it is disabled unless explicitly enabled.
    - implemented dns tunneling (experimental now and in the future).
    - remove support for pre-release version protocol.
    - updated tincd drivers (rev 1433), added uml_socket driver, documented
      tincd drivers a bit better.
    - document icmp configuration values.
    - document transport protocols in gvpe.protocol(7).
    - remove unused ChangeLog file.
    - created a mailinglist at gvpe@lists.schmorp.de.
    - added an exemption to allow distribution of binaries linked against
      OpenSSL, as suggested by Guus Sliepen (author of tinc). No
      GNUTLS conversion in sight.
    - some portability fixes with respect to --disable-nls.

1.7 Tue Feb 22 23:58:59 CET 2005
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - first gnu release.
    - documented the special value 1 for router-priority.
    - renamed vped => gvpe and vpectrl => gvpectrl, as well as
      vped.conf => gvpe.conf.
    - new per-node option "max-retry".
    - asymmetric rekeying behaviour, so hosts do NOT rekey simultaneously.
    - new configure option --enable-static-daemon.
    - fix configure --help output.
    - many documentation layout fixes.
    - synced iom.[Ch] from rxvt-unicode.
    - try to cope with some non-monotonic time changes.
    - revert to locale.h - a usual, clocale is nonfunctioning on macosx.
    - considerably improved pod2texi and the resulting texi doc.

1.6.1 Wed May 12 14:48:20 CEST 2004
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - fix -c switch that has been broken due to a last-minute fix
      to option and config file parsing.

1.6 Mon May 10 20:55:10 CEST 2004
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - do not RESET on out-of-sequence packets (good for wireless).
    - various non-security-related bugfixes.
    - c++ify (at least make it compile with g++-3.4, which should make
      it a little bit more standard c++).

1.5 Fri Jan 30 00:50:04 CET 2004
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - vped will refuse to start when hostkey and public key do not match.
    - updated lzf code to version 1.2.
    - better error reporting for "unusual" conditions, like failing
      to allocate memory, that should not normally happen and
      will otherwise result in spurious other error messages. Also
      adds paranoid checks in case openssl's API changes in a bad way.
    - fix a bug where queued vpn packets were cleared to zero. while
      this does NOT affect security, it did cause warning messages and
      unnecessary connectivity delays.

1.4 Sat Jan 17 15:49:21 CET 2004
    - protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
    - better retry behaviour on key mismatch.
    - use select-based io_manager instead of poll-based one.
    - share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe.
    - sooo many *BSD workarounds because no BSD I could find is even
      remotely POSIX-compatible.

1.2 Fri Oct 17 03:44:44 CEST 2003
    - protocol version 0.1.
    - tincd kernel interface code imported, more supported platforms
      (native/linux (2.4), tincd/linux (2.2 and 2.4), tincd/freebsd,
      native/cygwin).
    - added primitive ethernet emulation (ipv4 only), which allows
      the following platforms that only have tun drivers to work:
      /* none yet tested */
    - portability workarounds, especially for unfriendly freebsd
    - very minor bugfixes
    - warnings when choosing insecure ciphers/hashes
    - reduced default hmac length to 8.
    - cvs now contains configure, Makefile.in and other generated files.
    - added doc/complex-example to the distribution.

1.0 distant past
    - protocol version 0.1.
    - tweaked various timeouts to help very slow (486) class
      machines or nets with many hosts.
    - tweaked rate-limiting to be more forgiving for hosts
      connecting through routers (not a fix).
